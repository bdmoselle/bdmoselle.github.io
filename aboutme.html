								<p><b>I am a Certified Nutrition Therapy Practitioner whose purpose is to help you live a happy, healthy life through nutrition consultations and by utilizing a combination of locally
								produced food, whole food supplements, and lifestyle changes</b></p>
								
								

<p>There are so many areas to focus on when dealing with nutrition but my passion is children.  More specifically, couples that are looking to start a family.  I was recently asked what my recommendation is for pre-natal vitamins / supplements.  Based on everything I’ve learned independently and through schooling it is my belief that a healthy pregnancy starts before a child is conceived.</p>
<p>If I could sum up my thoughts on what it takes to have a healthy pregnancy and child, it’s this:  <b>Women, and men, need to be properly mineralized for at least 6 months, ideally 1 year, before starting a family.</b>  It takes way more than vitamins to have a healthy pregnancy because without the proper supply of minerals in your body, the vitamins you’re eating or supplementing with cannot do their job.  This quote highlights this sentiment perfectly:</p>
<p></p><b>“Vitamins do nothing in the body if you don't have the proper minerals in the body.  "It is not commonly realized, however, that vitamins control the body's appropriation of minerals, and in the absence of minerals they have no function to perform. Lacking vitamins, the system can make some use of minerals, but lacking minerals, vitamins are useless."</b>  This is a quote from the 1936 US Senate soil study.  (https://cdn.sare.org/wp-content/uploads/20171204123125/united-states-senate-document-264.pdf"</p>
<p>Another shocking thing people don’t realize is our soil is completely deficient and nearly dead.  Another quote from the study above, “The alarming fact is that foods, fruits and vegetables and grains, now being raised on millions of acres of land that no longer contain enough of certain needed minerals, are starving us - no matter how much of them we eat!”  It doesn’t matter if you eat 100% organic all of the time, the soil simply isn’t providing the nutrients (vitamins / minerals) we need, therefore, in my opinion, supplementation is necessary.  <b>I work with supplement companies that provide 100% whole food nutrients in high concentrations - nothing synthetic - ever!</p></b>  
<p>Minerals are the raw materials our bodies need to operate efficiently and to prevent disease.  They are also the building blocks a developing child needs during pregnancy.  If baby is deficient, it will take from Mom (cavities are common during pregnancy because baby is not being supplied with enough calcium, for example).  Dr. Joel Wallach, who specializes in minerals, has also said the munchies, or cravings, in pregnancy is the result of the mother being mineral deficient.</p>  
<p>If you are looking to start a family, please contact me to setup an appointment to go over my recommendations for properly mineralizing Mom, Dad, and the developing child so they have the best start they possibly can.  I can help provide dietary guidance and protocols from pre-conception all the way through pregnancy and your breast feeding journey. Nothing would bring me more joy than to help you create a life that has all the building blocks it needs to develop properly and thrive once they say hello to the world.</p>
<p>I also specialize in pregnancy and breast feeding protocols.  Everything I recommend I’ve done with my family and have had incredible results and I want you to experience the same joy I have.</p>  
<p>Even if this model doesn’t fit where you are in your life, I also specialize in creating vitamin & mineral supplementation protocols for individuals looking to optimize their health.</p>
